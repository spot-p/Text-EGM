# Reproduction of Text-EGM: [Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual Representations]
This repository contains our reproduction of the paper Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual Representations by Han et al., 2024.
The official code base can be found at willxxy/Text-EGM.

## Scope of Reproduction:
Our goal was to reproduce the key components of the model-pipeline, inferred metrics and visualizations against the external dataset used in the paper.
This reproduction does not assess the efficacy or generalizability of this method. The reproduced results are completely based on the external dataset alone.
The external dataset used in the paper is from (Goldberger et al., 2000) accessible here: https://physionet.org/content/iafdb/1.0.0/
